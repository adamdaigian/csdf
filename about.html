          <p>In early 2015, David Blacker, San Francisco family lawyer, and Marjorie Slabach, retired Family Law Commissioner of the San Francisco Superior Court, began a series of discussions about ways to improve the court system for families going through separation or divorce. Dave and Marge had a vision of a supportive model separate from the adversarial system that could address the legal, emotional and financial needs of families in transition.</p>
          <p>A group of mental health professionals who specialize in divorce and work with the courts and/or alternative dispute processes, were invited with other like-minded professionals, including lawyers, and financial professionals to join them in this endeavor. This experienced interdisciplinary group explored how best to offer professional expertise to help clients create individualized legal, parenting and financial plans. Out of these discussions, The Center for Separating and Divorcing Families (“CSDF”) was developed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>We are in the process of creating a non-profit organization as an alternative to the California Family Court. CSDF will offer multi-disciplinary services to assist families to efficiently and cost effectively move through the separation and divorce process, with the focus on helping families address the needs of the children and the health of the post-divorce/separated family.</p>
          <p>The goal of CSDF is both to complete the legal aspects of a family’s case and to ease a family’s re-structuring. For a flat fee, they will receive mediation, mental health services (including co-parent counseling), and financial advising as required by the particular needs of the family.</p>
